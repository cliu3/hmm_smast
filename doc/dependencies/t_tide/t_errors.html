  To generate a harmonic analysis, we

     a) fit the series to either sines and cosines at specified
        (positive) frequencies, or to complex exponentials at both
        positive and negative frequencies. Traditionally sine/cosines
        have been used, in t_tide I deal with the complex exponentials
        as the math is conceptually (and practically) simpler. The
        use of complex exponentials also unifies the treatment of
        real time series (e.g. tidal height) and complex time
        series (e.g. currents, u+i*v).
     b) The complex amplitudes of constituents are corrected for
        various factors (nodal modulations, inference, etc.)...
     c) ...and then converted to ellipse parameters (semi-major axis,
        Greenwich phase, etc.).

  Since it is well-known that some of the less-important constituents
  can be below the &quot;geophysical noise&quot; level, it is important to have 
  confidence intervals for these estimates, giving some idea about
  their trustworthiness for predictive purposes.

  Currently two different methods of estimating confidence intervals
  are implemented in t_tide.

  1) &quot;Linear Analysis&quot;

  Munk and Cartwright in their paper on the &quot;response method&quot; (Phil. 
  Trans Roy. Soc. Lon. A, vol 259, 1966, pg 533-581) outlined the
  analysis for estimating noise levels in spectra. Although this was 
  used for &quot;transfer function&quot; estimates, the formalism was adapted by 
  W. S. Brown and J. D. Irish (unpublished notes, 1991) for the case
  when the transfer function is the output of a harmonic analysis. 
  A conversion from errors in the cos/sine amplitudes to errors
  in ellipse parameters (axis lengths, inclination, etc.) can be done
  through a linearized analysis (B. Beardsley, unpublished notes, 1999,
  checking earlier work by R. Signell).

  In essence, 9 frequency bands are chosen, bracketing M0,M1...M8. In 
  each band the amplitude of the residual power spectrum is estimated.
  It is then assumed that this noise contaminates both sin and cosine
  components of the harmonic fit equally. Errors in ellipse parameters
  are determined through a linearized analysis in which variances are
  summed, weighted by analytically calculated sensitivity terms.

  The results appears to be adequate for real time series (e.g., 
  tidal height), as long as the SNR (amp/error)^2 &lt;10, and is probably 
  not bad for SNR as low as 2 or 3.

  The formalism has been extended to complex time series, with the
  assumption that noise in the real and imaginary parts is 
  uncorrelated, although the levels of noise in both directions are 
  allowed to be different. Unfortunately this means that error bars 
  are not rotationally independent, i.e., the size of error bars may 
  change depending on whether you input your time series in N/E 
  coordinates, or along/across bathymetry coordinates. 

  I visualize the bivariate error model by seeing it as an ellipse on
  the plane - if the ellipse is not pointing along the x or y axes,
  this error analysis will fail to produce the correct results. Of 
  course, you can always rotate the coordinate system so that it is 
  aligned with the axes.

  Thus I currently recommend that if you really care about your CI,
  you submit your time series in a coordinate system in which the
  ellipse semi-major axis lies roughly along one of the coordinate 
  axes.
  

 2) &quot;Nonlinear analysis&quot;

 The linear analysis described above has two problems - first, it 
 linearizes a non-linear transformation, and second, it doesn't really
 account for complex noise which might be correlated.

 The first problem is probably not much of an issue, since it is of
 concern only at very low SNR where the results are probably not very
 useful anyway. However, it would be nice to do something about this.
 The second problem is more serious (in my opinion), since it 
 potentially affects any kind of current analysis.

 The modern way of dealing with nonlinearity is through resampling
 techniques. Here I use a 'parametric bootstrap'. The idea is to
 estimate an uncertainty in the complex amplitudes of the constituents.
 Assuming the original noise to be roughly white, so will the noise in
 the complex coefficients. However, there are interesting correlations
 between the real and imaginary parts of both positive and negative
 frequencies. These can be written in terms of a 4x4 matrix in which
 the variance and covariance of the real and imaginary parts of the 
 time series appear. An eigenvalue decomposition can be used to 
 generate a transformation matrix that will take 4 uncorrelated white
 noise series and give us noise of the correct characteristics; this 
 can then be use to generate a series of 'constituent replicates'.

 The replicates are then nonlinearly transformed into ellipse 
 parameters, and confidence intervals estimated directly from the 
 results, taking into account the nonlinearity.
 
 The computational time required is essentially minimal using a modern
 PC.

 Thus, this can account for both the nonlinear transformation, and for
 correlated noise! So, what's the problem?

 The first is that, so far, I have done the math for just two cases:
  a) white, correlated continuum spectrum (suitable for complex time
     series with a flat background spectrum)
  b) coloured, uncorrelated continuum spectrum (suitable for scalar
     time series with a sloped background spectrum).

 Ideally, of course, I would like to handle coloured, correlated noise.
 I'm working on it...


 SUMMARY

 For scalar time series - either method is OK. The nonlinear method
 handles low SNR cases slightly better. This shows how well both 
 methods work for a relatively low noise level (for a detailed 
 explanation of the plots, see 'help t_synth'):

 &gt;t_synth('nrun',40,'error','.1*colrand(SY,-1)','time',[0:24*30],'tidecon',[1 0 0 60]);

 And this is for higher noise levels where the transformations is more
 nonlinear.

 &gt;t_synth('nrun',40,'error','20*colrand(SY,-1)','time',[0:24*30],'tidecon',[1 0 0 60]);
 
 For vector time series. If your noise is isotropic (in space), but
 coloured (in time), both methods work fine. Again, the nonlinear 
 method handles low SNR cases slightly better:

 &gt;t_synth('nrun',40,'error','.01*(colrand(SY,-1)+i*colrand(SY,-1))','time',[0:24*30]);

 &gt;t_synth('nrun',20,'error','10*(colrand(SY,-1)+i*colrand(SY,-1))','time',[0:24*30]);

 If your noise is non-isotropic (in space) and spectrally flat (in time), 
 the nonlinear analysis wins hands down. Here is an extreme case, where the
 noise is at 45 degrees to the axes:

 &gt;t_synth('nrun',20,'error','.1*(1+i)*randn(SY)','time',[0:24*30],'boota','w');

 However, noise is hardly ever spectrally flat in real life.

 If your noise is non-isotropic (in space) and spectrally coloured,
 then AS LONG AS YOU ROTATE THE TIME SERIES so that the noise in real
 and imaginary parts is uncorrelated, which is always possible for
 bivariate noise, then both methods works fine.
